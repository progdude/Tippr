## Notes

The main challenge I had was working with the UIImageViews to make the images suit the iOS background well. In addition, I experimented with adding constraints to attach the image to the background, but it really stretched the image.
In addition, I had a bit of trouble getting the data to store, but that wasn't too much trouble.
